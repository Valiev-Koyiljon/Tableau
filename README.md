# Tableau Projects

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Tableau projects! This repository showcases a collection of interactive data visualizations and dashboards created using Tableau.

## Project Overview

The Tableau Projects repository is a showcase of my data visualization skills and explores various datasets through the power of Tableau. Each project focuses on a specific topic or domain, presenting insightful visualizations that uncover patterns, trends, and key insights within the data.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: The projects feature interactive visualizations that allow users to explore the data, apply filters, and gain deeper insights. You can interact with the charts, graphs, and maps to understand the data from different perspectives.

- **Rich Data Analysis**: The projects utilize Tableau's rich features and functionality to conduct comprehensive data analysis. From data preprocessing to advanced calculations, the visualizations provide a comprehensive view of the underlying data.

- **Dashboard Design**: The projects include carefully designed dashboards that present the visualizations in a cohesive and intuitive manner. The dashboards provide a holistic view of the data and enable users to understand the key takeaways at a glance.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into separate directories for each Tableau project. Each project directory contains the Tableau workbook file, accompanying datasets, and a brief description of the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Tableau Projects repository, follow these steps:

1. Explore the individual project directories to discover the Tableau workbooks and datasets available.

2. Open the Tableau workbook file (.twb or .twbx) using Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public to interact with the visualizations and dashboards.

3. Analyze the visualizations, apply filters, and explore the insights presented in each project.
